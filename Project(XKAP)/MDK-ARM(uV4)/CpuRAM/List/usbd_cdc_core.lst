N  * @date    19-March-2012
N  * @brief   This file provides the high layer firmware functions to manage the 
N  *          following functionalities of the USB CDC Class:
N  *           - Initialization and Configuration of high and low layer
N  *           - Enumeration as CDC Device (and enumeration for each implemented memory interface)
N  *           - OUT/IN data transfer
N  *           - Command IN transfer (class requests management)
N  *           - Error management
N  *

N  *          ===================================================================      
N  *                                CDC Class Driver Description
N  *          =================================================================== 
N  *           This driver manages the "Universal Serial Bus Class Definitions for Communications Devices
N  *           Revision 1.2 November 16, 2007" and the sub-protocol specification of "Universal Serial Bus 
N  *           Communications Class Subclass Specification for PSTN Devices Revision 1.2 February 9, 2007"
N  *           This driver implements the following aspects of the specification:
N  *             - Device descriptor management
N  *             - Configuration descriptor management
N  *             - Enumeration as CDC device with 2 data endpoints (IN and OUT) and 1 command endpoint (IN)
N  *             - Requests management (as described in section 6.2 in specification)
N  *             - Abstract Control Model compliant
N  *             - Union Functional collection (using 1 IN endpoint for control)
N  *             - Data interface class
N
N  *           @note
N  *             For the Abstract Control Model, this core allows only transmitting the requests to
N  *             lower layer dispatcher (ie. usbd_cdc_vcp.c/.h) which should manage each request and
N  *             perform relative actions.
N  * 
N  *           These aspects may be enriched or modified for a specific user application.
N  *          
N  *            This driver doesn't implement the following aspects of the specification 
N  *            (but it is possible to manage these features with some modifications on this driver):
N  *             - Any class-specific aspect relative to communication classes should be managed by user application.
N  *             - All communication classes other than PSTN are not managed
N  *
